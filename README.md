> Protect Got requests from SSRF

### üè† [Homepage](https://github.com/JaneJeon/got-ssrf)

## Why does this matter?

SSRF is the evil sibling to CSRF that essentially allows RCE against your backends: https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf.

This module automatically rejects all suchs requests so you can safely use got without even thinking about it.

## Install

```sh
npm i got-ssrf
```

## Usage

Note that this package is ESM-only; see https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c for what to do if you're using CJS (i.e. `require()`). In addition, due to its usage of `dns/promises`, it only runs on node v15 or higher.

```js
import { gotSsrf } from 'got-ssrf'

await gotSsrf(url) // automatically filters requests for safety
```

If you have any other plugins you want to "mix" got-ssrf with, see https://github.com/sindresorhus/got/blob/main/documentation/examples/advanced-creation.js for how to do so. Example:

```js
import got from 'got'
import { gotSsrf } from 'got-ssrf'
import { gotInstance } from 'some-other-got-plugin'

const merged = got.extend(gotSsrf, gotInstance)
```

## Run tests

```sh
npm test
```
